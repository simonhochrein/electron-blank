this is part of an application i'm building tht will be used to package a website in an application.
It also can be used as a standalone project
to use you can
```
   git clone https://github.com/simonhochrein/electron-blank
   cd electron-blank
   npm install
```
you will need to edit the ```settings.json``` file
this is the json tree
* ```width``` the width of the application
* ```height``` the height of the application
* ```url``` the url to the webpage that the application renders
